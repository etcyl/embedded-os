The restrictions for this assignment are uncreatively listed here in their original form:

1. Create a program that creates 4 threads where each thread prints out its thread Id. 

   To run this program (print_threads.c) on an Ubuntu system try:
   $ gcc print_threads.c -lpthread
   $ ./a.out

2. Develop a multithreaded program to sort an array of integers.

For full info on 1 and 2, read the assignment5.pdf in this repo.
